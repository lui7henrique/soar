# observa√ß√µes

- algumas medidas do layout no figma possuem valores que nao sao multiplos de 8, causando um "desconforto" visual a longo prazo
  uma melhoria pertinente seria repassarp por esses valores
- outra melhoria seria considerar mapear todos as cores da aplica√ß√£o e ter definido no figma para evitar o uso de cores soltas
- pelo minha disponibilidade de tempo, eu to usando mock diretamente no c√≥digo, mas em um universo ideal, eu usaria um msw (preferencialmente) ou json-server para mockar ter acesso aos estados de loading da aplica√ß√£o ü§ù
